# Hand Gesture Recognition System

This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** using machine learning techniques. The system recognizes hand gestures based on **keypoint classification** and **point history classification**. It uses frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Mediapipe** for hand tracking and gesture recognition.

---

## Features

- **Keypoint Classification**: Identifies gestures based on 21 hand keypoints (x, y coordinates).
- **Point History Classification**: Recognizes gestures by analyzing the historical movement of hand points.
- **Real-time Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for live video capture and gesture recognition.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for both keypoint and point history classification.
